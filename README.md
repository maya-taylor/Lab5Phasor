This project detects the phase difference between two sinusoidal functions and displays a phasor and sinusoidal graph animation of the sinusoidal inputs. It also creates and plays a .wav file, the sum of the two sinusoidal inputs. 

Inputs:
- Reference input sinusoidal function with frequency between 50 and 250Hz
- Input sinusoidal function with frequency between 50 and 250Hz

Produces:
- Animated phasor rotation and a sinusoid graph that includes the phase difference, frequency, and magnitude of each input signal
- .wav file that is a summation of the input sinusoids
